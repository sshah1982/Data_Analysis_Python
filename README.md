# Data_Analysis_Python

By taking Cars dataset (CSV) as a sample, I've prepared Jupyter notebooks for Basic EDA and Data Cleaning tasks. 

After first step, various aggregations are also shown by using Pandas library.

Main challenge in EDA is to get raw data and clean and transform it in a useful form which can drive next steps of data transformations.
This step can also find outliers.

After step 1 and 2, I've explored various common data formats used in Data Analysis like JSON, XML, Excel, Parquet and HTML.

Each data format comes with it's own pros and cons.

(1) CSV:

Pros:
- Most easy and straight-forward
- Very lightweight
- Human Readable
- Can be parsed by MS Excel too

Cons:
-
